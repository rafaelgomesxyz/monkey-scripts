Useful library for dealing with the DOM.

It simplifies the process of:

- Waiting for an element that is dynamically added to the DOM
- Inserting elements with attributes / events and retrieving their references, using an array structure visually similar to JSX
- Observing a node for mutations
- Parsing an HTML string into a DOM
