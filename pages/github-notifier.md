# GitHub Notifier

Notifies the user whenever they have new unread notifications on GitHub.

### [Install](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/405937-github-notifier)

### How does it work?

It observes the mail icon in the header of the page. When the icon indicates new unread notifications, it adds '(New)' to the title of the tab and shows a browser notification if you are away from the tab.

### Examples

After installing the script, you can test it by taking the following steps:

1. Open multiple GitHub tabs
2. Go to your notifications page ([https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications)) in one of the tabs
3. Select any notification and mark it as unread
4. All open tabs should immediately have '(New)' in their title
