A collection of all my Greasemonkey scripts.

## How to install

Each script can be installed through the same steps:

### 1. Install a userscript manager, for example:

- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

### 2. Go to the page of the script that you want to install and click on 'Install':

- [Enhanced BLAEO](enhanced-blaeo)
- [GitHub Notifier](github-notifier)
- [SGTools Notifier](sgtools-notifier)
- [Steam Store Redirector](steam-store-redirector)

### Enjoy!
